- First of all, this repository is forked from [sivantoledo/javAX25](https://github.com/sivantoledo/javAX25), based in the great job of [Sivan Toledo](https://github.com/sivantoledo), so all credits goes to him. Sivan also wrote a documentation that describes how the origal source-code was done. I've added this doc [this repository wiki](https://github.com/damico/javAX25/wiki/Manual:-AX25-Java-Soundcard-Modem).
